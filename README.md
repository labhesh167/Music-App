# Music-App
*Problem: Music App Simulation*

Create an Interface called Playable

It should have one method: void play();

Create an Abstract Class called Instrument that:

Implements Playable

Has a concrete method tune() that prints "Instrument is being tuned."

Has an abstract method void repair();

Create a Final Class called Guitar that:

Extends Instrument

Implements the play() method (print "Guitar is playing music.")

Implements the repair() method (print "Repairing the Guitar.")

In the main method:

Create an object of Guitar.

Call tune(), play(), and repair() methods.

 Bonus Challenge (if you want extra):
Try to extend the Guitar class into another class ElectricGuitar and observe what error you get!
